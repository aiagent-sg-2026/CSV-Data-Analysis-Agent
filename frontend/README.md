# Editable React source

This directory is the source package for the checked-in static app at the repository root. It was recovered from `React-CSV-Data-Analysis-Agent-Backup` revision `b268e31b37de94ea3b7a5b9e604ce3eca3a48e3d`; the rebuilt deployment matches the original SHA-256 manifest.

- `index.tsx` and `App.tsx` own bootstrap and the application shell.
- `components/` owns presentation, `store/` owns UI and data state, and `services/` owns agent, AI, data, persistence, and worker behavior.
- `tests/` contains unit tests and synthetic report fixtures. Local business reports in `sample csv/` and their benchmark snapshots are ignored by Git; tests that require that corpus are kept out of the public repository.
- `public/` holds small source templates. Build preparation copies large runtime resources from the repository root into ignored `public/` subdirectories.
- The repository [README](../README.md) describes the current source/deployment boundary and agent flow. Internal planning notes and corpus-dependent release procedures are not part of the public repository.
- `components/modals/PiBrowserLab.tsx` is an optional read-only Pi test panel opened from the Assistant header after a CSV is loaded. `services/agent/runtime/pi/piBrowserAgent.ts` owns its bounded Pi tool loop and calls the existing DuckDB query engine for complete-dataset aggregates. The main assistant and initial analysis now use the browser Pi Harness.

The main Pi runtime uses the provider and model selected in Settings and the app's cloud AI consent gate. It has no Node.js runtime dependency. Read-only tools use the existing app manifests; dataset changes require an explicit review in chat. Interrupted initial-analysis stages with uncertain effects require a fresh retry.

Use Node.js `>=22.13 <23`. From the repository root, run `npm ci --prefix frontend`, then `npm run dev`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, or `npm run build`. The build output is `frontend/dist/`; publish it to the checked-in static root with `npm run publish:root` after review.

Localization coverage is checked by `tests/localizationCoverage.test.ts`. The Japanese, Malay, and placeholder baselines in `tests/fixtures/localization-coverage-baseline.json` are currently empty; `docs/localization-coverage.md` reports any gaps by key prefix. After changing translations, run `npx vitest run --environment jsdom tests/localizationCoverage.test.ts` from `frontend/`. When a reviewed translation closes an existing gap, regenerate both files with `UPDATE_LOCALIZATION_BASELINE=1 npx vitest run --environment jsdom tests/localizationCoverage.test.ts` and review the diff; the normal test rejects new gaps and stale baseline entries.
