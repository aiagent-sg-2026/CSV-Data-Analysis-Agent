    Evidence-query rules (hard constraints — SQL contract limits):
    - First decide what grouped evidence should be computed.
    - Do not decide chartType yet.
    - Do not return bindings, defaultTopN, or defaultHideOthers.
    - query.select must explicitly include every output column or aggregate alias used later.
    - If you define aggregate aliases, keep them simple and legal, and include them in query.select.
    - Use only the supported SQL contract: select, groupBy, aggregates, where, orderBy, and limit.

    Evidence-query preferences (ranked guidance — use your judgement):
    - Do NOT use blocked dimensions as groupBy columns. Use business grains instead. However, blocked dimensions CAN be used in WHERE clauses for filtering.
    - Prefer a single stable metric over speculative multi-metric comparisons.
    - Prefer aggregate evidence over raw rowset evidence unless the topic clearly requires a scatter-style rowset.
    - For any grouped aggregate query, ALWAYS include orderBy sorting by the primary aggregate descending and set a reasonable limit (8–15 unless the topic specifies a different N). This keeps results focused and chart-ready.
    - If the topic implies a time trend and a stable time column exists, set preferredResultShape to "time_series".
    - If the topic implies ranked grouped evidence, set preferredResultShape to "ranked_aggregate".
    - If the best result is a row-level exploratory view, set preferredResultShape to "rowset_scatter_candidate" or "detail_table".
    - Use business-facing naming when the dataset evidence supports it, but do not invent unsupported business aliases.
    - If the data exploration context mentions a row-classification column with detail/fact rows, ALWAYS include a WHERE predicate filtering to detail rows only. This prevents double-counting from subtotal/header rows.

    ${contextText}

    Based on this, generate a list of concise analysis topics.
    - List the topics from most to least useful for a decision-maker; the order is kept. Prefer a measure that matches what the column means (for example a typical price, not a sum of prices). When one row is one transaction or event, compare groups by a typical value per row (median or average); a sum of a per-row value mostly reflects how many rows each group has, so use it only for an explicit total.
    - Good examples: "Sum of Revenue by Product Category", "Count of Orders per Month", "Relationship between Unit Cost and Profit".
    - Bad examples: "Chart of the data", "Analyze everything", "Make a pie chart".

    Hard constraints (SQL contract limits — these cannot be violated):
    - Each topic must be answerable with one SQL query using grouping, filtering, ordering, and limiting.
    - Each topic must be compatible with the available SQL contract and supported chart bindings.
    - Avoid topics requesting descriptive statistics (like mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles) that the current SQL contract cannot express directly.

    Preferences:
    1. Do NOT use blocked dimensions as groupBy — use only the available non-blocked dimensions listed below. Blocked dimensions are identified by the data investigation harness based on data content, not column names.
    2. Use preferred business terms from report title/parameters when supported. Use report scope for topic selection (e.g. "Income Statement By Project" → compare across projects).
    ${groupByConstraint}
    4. Prefer SUM for financial metric aggregations. Use COUNT when the topic asks about frequency or occurrence count.
    5. If exploration results are provided, use them: low-cardinality dimensions are good for groupBy, fragmented dimensions need WHERE filters.
    6. Do not invent qualifiers (fiscal, primary, category) unless explicitly supported by the data.
    7. Do NOT mention row-classification or row-index columns in topic text. Row filtering is handled automatically during query planning.
    8. Prefer decision-useful outcomes such as revenue, profit, margin, change over time, concentration, and exceptions over mechanical breakdowns by unit, currency, or formatting fields. Use unit or currency only when it materially changes interpretation.
    9. Keep each topic to one clear analytical relationship: one primary metric and one grouping dimension, or an explicit two-dimension cross-tab with a stated comparison purpose. Do not combine unrelated dimensions in one sentence.
    ${availableDimensions && availableDimensions.length > 0 ? `\n    Available non-blocked groupBy dimensions: ${availableDimensions.join(', ')}.` : ''}

    - Only choose "line" when the groupBy column is a time or ordinal dimension with monotonic ordering in the evidence.
    - Only choose "scatter" when the evidence is a rowset query with two numeric columns suitable for x/y axes.
    - If the review context indicates contamination, unsafe narrative, or blocked dimensions, prefer "table".

    Evaluation guidelines:
    - "pass" when the evidence clearly answers the topic with meaningful grouped or trend data.
    - "table_only" when the evidence is informative but too weak, fragmented, or ambiguous for a chart. A data table is still useful.
    - "reject" when the evidence is empty, trivially uniform, or does not answer the topic at all.
    - A result with 2 rows can still be "pass" if the topic asks for a comparison between exactly 2 items.
    - A result with 50+ distinct groups is usually "table_only" because a chart would be unreadable.
    - A result with only 1 group or 0 metric variance should be "reject".
    - If the groupBy column is a blocked or helper dimension (listed in the semantic context), prefer "table_only" rather than "reject" — the data may still be useful as a table even if it's not chart-worthy.
    - If the semantic context lists parent/subtotal labels or hierarchy information, check whether the preview rows contain those labels. If they do, the aggregation may be contaminated (double-counting parent totals) — prefer "table_only" and set chartWorthy to false.
    - If the semantic context lists duplicate/alias labels, check whether the preview rows contain those labels. If they do, the grouping may produce misleading totals — prefer "table_only" and set chartWorthy to false.
    - If the groupBy column is listed as a blocked grain column by the harness, the evidence is not chart-worthy.
    - chartWorthy should be true when the evidence has a clear visual story (trend, ranking, comparison), false when the table alone is sufficient or the evidence has contamination signals.
